Driven by a passion for integrating robots into human environments, my career
has centered on reactive motion planning. Over the past five years in academic
research, I have pioneered novel methods for online motion planning in mobile
manipulation, utilizing non-linear optimization and Riemannian geometry.
Committed to the open-source community, I ensure my research and software are
publicly accessible. Understanding the complexities and challenges of reliable
robotics, I have actively participated in robotic competitions, and I am
enthusiastic about joining a competitive team in my next role.
