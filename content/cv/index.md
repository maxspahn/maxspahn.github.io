## About
Driven by a passion for integrating robots into human environments, my career
has centered on reactive motion planning. Over the past five years in academic
research, I have pioneered novel methods for online motion planning in mobile
manipulation, utilizing non-linear optimization and Riemannian geometry.
Committed to the open-source community, I ensure my research and software are
publicly accessible. Understanding the complexities and challenges of reliable
robotics, I have actively participated in robotic competitions, and I am
enthusiastic about joining a competitive team in my next role.

## Skills

**optimization:** non-linear constrained optimization for dynamic programming, optimization on Riemannian manifolds, Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning

**robotics:** forward and inverse kinematics, impedance control for compliant trajectory
  generation, receding horizon motion control, collision avoidance in
  human-shared environments in real-time

**programming:** ROS (noetic, melodic), python, git, C++, LaTeX, bash

**project management:** leading and contributing to collaborative research projects, supervising several undergraduate students

**languages:** German, English and French

## Projects

### Geometric Fabrics for robot trajectory generation
- Geometric fabrics formulate trajectory generation as second order dynamical
  systems on (non-)Riemannian manifolds
- This implementation is robot-agnostic and has been used in several research
  projects
- The project uses continuous integration and modern software engineering
  practices
